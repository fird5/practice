            <h2>The Core Concept: A High-Stakes Duel</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the next generation of competitive innovation. The <strong>AI Esports Malaysia Varsity Challenge</strong> is designed as a fast-paced, high-stakes competition that pits two individual innovators against each other in a head-to-head duel.</p>
            <p>This is a pure test of your ability to be resourceful and creative under pressure. The winner is the person who can not only come up with the most novel idea but also execute it in a visually compelling way in a very short amount of time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The 60-Minute Match Clock</h2>
            <p>The entire challenge is contained within a single hour, divided into two distinct phases.</p>
            <h3>Innovation Sprint (30 minutes)</h3>
            <p>This is your core creation phase. You will receive a challenge topic and a **lateral thinking input** (like a "random word" or a "provocation"). Your objective is to use AI tools to generate and refine a set of three visual assets based on this input. The tight time limit forces you to think laterally and go with your intuition, rather than getting stuck on one idea.</p>
            <h3>Live Showcase (30 minutes)</h3>
            <p>This is the competition phase. You get 15 minutes to showcase your work and present your solution to the judges. The presentation is not a formal pitch but a live, visually-driven performance. The final 5 minutes of your presentation are a live Q&A with the judges, which adds to the pressure.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What is Lateral Thinking? Your Key to Victory.</h2>
            <p>Lateral thinking is your secret weapon in this competition. It's a method of solving problems by breaking away from traditional, step-by-step logic. Instead of digging a single hole deeper, you find a completely new place to dig. It encourages you to disrupt your usual thought patterns to discover novel solutions.</p>
            <p>To help you, we provide a **lateral thinking input**, which is a deliberate tool to force this creative shift. This will be an absurd or unrelated starting point that you must connect to the challenge. This process of "forced connection" is what will help you generate truly original and unexpected ideas.</p>
            <p>For example, if the challenge is to "improve urban transportation," a lateral thinking input might be: "PO, all cars should have square wheels." This forces you to think about vertical space, separate traffic flows, and new infrastructureâ€”ideas you wouldn't have considered otherwise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Visual "In-Game" Assets</h2>
            <p>Instead of a traditional PowerPoint deck or a written report, your deliverables are a series of on-screen visual assets. These assets are the tangible products of your work and are designed to be immediately visible to the audience.</p>
            <ul class="assets-list">
                <li><strong>The "Live-Generated Visual":</strong> This is the first asset you create. It is a single, high-quality image that encapsulates your core concept. It serves as a visual "first move" in the duel and sets the tone for the rest of your solution.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Live-Animated 12-Second Loop":</strong> This is the centerpiece of your solution. It's a short, animated video that visually explains a key feature of your concept. This asset demonstrates your ability to create a dynamic, compelling narrative with a specific tool.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Live-Edited Moodboard":</strong> This is the supporting asset. It's a collage of AI-generated images that defines the aesthetic and emotional tone of your brand. It provides a visual reference for the judges and helps them understand the creative vision.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Judging & Scoring System</h2>
            <p>The judging process is transparent and immediate, with scores displayed on a live scoreboard. The judges evaluate each player on three criteria that reflect their overall performance.</p>
            <div class="scoreboard">
                <h3>Final Scoreboard</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conceptual Cohesion Score (40 points):</strong> This is the most important score. It measures the logical and creative vision behind your assets. The judges are looking for a clear narrative that ties all the assets together into a single, cohesive, and novel solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Articulative Ingenuity Score (35 points):</strong> This score measures your ability to explain your creative process and justify your choices during the live Q&A. The judges want to see that you have a deep understanding of your own solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Impact Score (25 points):</strong> This score is a measure of the quality and polish of your visual assets. The judges are looking for compelling visuals that have a powerful and immediate impact on the audience.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

            <h2>An Example Challenge: The "Sensory Scoreboard" Solo Duel</h2>
            <div class="challenge-example">
                <h3>Problem Narrative: The Emotional Disconnect</h3>
                <p>In the age of real-time data, fans have access to a mind-boggling amount of stats and analytics. However, these numbers often fail to capture the emotional drama and intensity of a game, leaving the fan feeling disconnected from the raw, unscripted moments that make sports so compelling. We need a solution that uses AI to translate a game's data into a multi-sensory experience that captures the "emotional narrative" of a game, making the fan feel the drama, not just read it.</p>

                <h3>Lateral Thinking Input: The "Analogy" Technique</h3>
                <p>We'll give you a provocative statement to get you started:</p>
                <blockquote><strong>Analogy: "A sports event is like a symphony orchestra."</strong></blockquote>
                <p>Your goal is to apply the principles of an orchestra (e.g., a conductor, a rhythm section, a crescendo, and a sense of harmonious unity) to a fan's multi-platform experience. Your solution must unify the fragmented fan experience into a single, immersive, and interactive community.</p>
